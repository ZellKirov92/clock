Creating a Clock
This project consists of creating an interactive clock using web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The clock will display the current time with hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. Here are the steps to make this project a reality :

HTML Structure: Create an HTML file with the basic structure. You'll need one container for the clock and three elements for the hands (hours, minutes, and seconds).

CSS Styles: Create a CSS file (styles.css) to style the clock. You can customize the colors, dimensions, and positions of the needles.

JavaScript logic: In the JavaScript (script.js) file, add the logic to update the clock hands based on the current time. Use the requestAnimationFrame function to make the clock dynamic

Customization: You can further customize the look and feel of your clock by changing CSS styles and adding additional functionality in JavaScript. For example, you could add a date display or a button to change the time zone.
